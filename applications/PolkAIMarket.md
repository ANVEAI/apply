# üìù PolkAI Market

## üåü Project Overview

- A decentralized marketplace for AI models powered by Polkadot
- PolkAI Market is a decentralized platform where AI models are tokenized as digital assets. It allows users to discover, license, and trade AI capabilities through transparent smart contracts, leveraging blockchain for provenance and fair compensation.
- PolkAI Market will be developed as a parachain application on Polkadot, utilizing ink! smart contracts on Astar or Moonbeam, and will employ XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) for interoperability with other data and compute parachains.
- The team is driven by the belief that AI is overly centralized and aims to democratize AI access, enable fair monetization for creators, and build a transparent, community-governed ecosystem.

                           | - Recommendations|
                           | - Model Metadata |
                           | - Search         |
                           +------------------+
```

#### What the project will NOT provide (initially):

- Will not host or run AI models directly
- No AI training infrastructure
- No token creation in initial phase
- No advanced AI agents beyond recommendations

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**  
  PolkAI Market creates infrastructure for decentralized AI commerce, sitting at the intersection of DeFi and AI, and introduces a new asset class of tokenized AI models.

- **Who is your target audience?**
  - AI developers & researchers
  - Businesses seeking transparent AI solutions
  - Web3 developers
  - End users looking for accessible AI tools

- **What need(s) does your project meet?**
  - Decentralized AI licensing
  - Transparent and fair AI model usage
  - Lower barriers for AI monetization
  - Enhanced discoverability for niche AI models

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?**  
  No current Polkadot-based AI marketplaces exist. While Singular exists for NFTs, PolkAI uniquely focuses on AI models and licensing, similar to Hugging Face but decentralized.

### Team's experience

Our team brings deep expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cybersecurity, and full-stack product development. We have successfully delivered a range of research-driven and consumer-facing projects, including intelligent automation systems, secure digital platforms, and user-centric AI applications.

Currently, we are actively involved in training and fine-tuning various Small Language Models (SLMs) and developing a suite of experimental AI agents. This includes rigorous research into agentic behavior, multi-agent cooperation, and model performance optimization across real-world use cases.

Our work is strongly supported by academic collaboration and cutting-edge infrastructure:

- Mentorship from top professors at IIT Kanpur, a leading technology institute in India
- Access to state-of-the-art research labs, including compute clusters with five NVIDIA A100 GPUs (each with 80GB VRAM), enabling us to train, simulate, and test large-scale AI models effectively

While we are relatively new to blockchain development, we bring a strong foundation in AI and product innovation‚Äîkey pillars for building intelligent and secure decentralized systems. We are committed to learning and contributing meaningfully to the Polkadot ecosystem as we evolve PolkAI Market.
